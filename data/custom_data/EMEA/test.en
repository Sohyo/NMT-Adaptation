What is Abraxane ?
Abraxane is a powder that is made up into a suspension for infusion ( drip into a vein ) .
It contains the active substance paclitaxel ( 5 mg/ ml ) .
What is Abraxane used for ?
Abraxane is used to treat metastatic breast cancer in patients whose first treatment for their metastatic disease has stopped working and for whom standard treatment including an anthracycline ( a type of anticancer medicine ) is not suitable . Metastatic means that the cancer has spread to other parts of the body .
Abraxane is used on its own .
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
How is Abraxane used ?
Abraxane should only be given under the supervision of a specialist cancer doctor in wards that are specialised in giving cytotoxic ( cell-killing ) medicines .
The recommended dose is 260 mg per square metre of body surface area ( calculated using the patient s height and weight ) .
It is given over a period of 30 minutes , every three weeks .
The dose may be reduced or treatment interrupted in patients who have certain side effects affecting the blood or the nerves .
Abraxane should not be used in patients who have severe problems with their liver .
The appropriate doses for patients with mild or moderate liver problems or with kidney problems are not known .
How does Abraxane work ?
The active substance in Abraxane , paclitaxel , belongs to the group of anticancer medicines known as the taxanes .
Paclitaxel blocks the ability of cancer cells to break down their internal skeleton that allows them to divide and multiply .
With their skeleton still in place , the cells cannot divide and they eventually die .
Abraxane also affects non-cancer cells such as blood and nerve cells , which can cause side effects .
Paclitaxel has been available as an anticancer medicine since 1993.
Conventional types of paclitaxel contain substances ( solvents ) that dissolve the paclitaxel , but can cause side effects .
Abraxane does not contain these solvents .

How has Abraxane been studied ?
The effects of Abraxane were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans .
The company also presented data from the published literature .
The effectiveness of Abraxane has been studied in one main study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , around three-quarters of whom had received an anthracycline in the past .
Around half of the patients in the study had already received treatments for their cancer after it had become metastatic .
The effects of Abraxane ( given on its own ) were compared with those of a conventional paclitaxel- containing medicine ( given together with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
The main measure of effectiveness was the number of patients who responded after at least five weeks of treatment .
This was defined as the patient s main tumours having disappeared or having shrunk in size by at least 30 % .
What benefit has Abraxane shown during the studies ?
Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel-containing medicines .
Overall , in the main study , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 women receiving Abraxane responded to treatment , compared with 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 receiving conventional paclitaxel-containing medicines .
When looking only at the patients who were receiving their first treatment for metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the medicines in terms of measures of effectiveness such as the time until the disease got worse and survival .
In contrast , in patients who had taken other treatments for metastatic breast cancer before , these additional measures showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel-containing medicines .
Therefore , the company withdrew its application for the use of Abraxane as first-line treatment during the assessment of the medicine .
What is the risk associated with Abraxane ?
The most common side effects with Abraxane ( seen in more than 1 patient in 10 ) are neutropenia ( low levels of neutrophils , a type of white blood cell ) , anaemia ( low red blood cell counts ) , leucopenia ( low levels of leucocytes , a type of white blood cell ) , thrombocytopenia ( low blood platelet counts ) , lymphopenia ( low levels of lymphocytes , a type of white blood cell ) , peripheral neuropathy ( nerve damage in the hands and feet ) , neuropathy ( nerve damage ) , hypoaesthesia ( reduced sense of touch ) , paraesthesia ( unusual sensations like pins and needles ) , nausea ( feeling sick ) , diarrhoea , vomiting , constipation , stomatitis ( inflammation of the lining of the mouth ) , alopecia ( hair loss ) , rash , arthralgia ( joint pain ) , myalgia ( muscle pain ) , anorexia ( loss of appetite ) , fatigue ( tiredness ) , asthenia ( weakness ) and pyrexia ( fever ) .
For the full list of all side effects reported with Abraxane , see the Package Leaflet .
Abraxane should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to paclitaxel or any of the other ingredients .
It should also not be used in patients who are breast feeding or who have low levels of neutrophils in the blood before starting treatment .
Why has Abraxane been approved ?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) noted that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel-containing medicines in patients whose first treatment had stopped working , and that , unlike other paclitaxel-containing medicines , it does not need other medicines to reduce side effects .
The Committee decided that Abraxane s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for whom standard , anthracycline-containing therapy is not indicated .
The Committee recommended that Abraxane be given marketing authorisation .

The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Abraxane to Abraxis BioScience Limited on 11 January 2008.

The most common side effects with Abraxane ( seen in more than 1 patient in 10 ) are neutropenia ( low levels of neutrophils , a type of white blood cell ) , anaemia ( low red blood cell counts ) , leucopenia ( low levels of leucocytes , a type of white blood cell ) , thrombocytopenia ( low blood platelet counts ) , lymphopenia ( low levels of lymphocytes , a type of white blood cell ) , peripheral neuropathy ( nerve damage in the hands and feet ) , neuropathy ( nerve damage ) , hypoaesthesia ( reduced sense of touch ) , paraesthesia ( unusual sensations like pins and needles ) , nausea ( feeling sick ) , diarrhoea , vomiting , constipation , stomatitis ( inflammation of the lining of the mouth ) , alopecia ( hair loss ) , rash , arthralgia ( joint pain ) , myalgia ( muscle pain ) , anorexia ( loss of appetite ) , fatigue ( tiredness ) , asthenia ( weakness ) and pyrexia ( fever ) .
For the full list of all side effects reported with Abraxane , see the Package Leaflet .
Abraxane should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to paclitaxel or any of the other ingredients .
It should also not be used in patients who are breast feeding or who have low levels of neutrophils in the blood before starting treatment .
Why has Abraxane been approved ?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) noted that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel-containing medicines in patients whose first treatment had stopped working , and that , unlike other paclitaxel-containing medicines , it does not need other medicines to reduce side effects .
The Committee decided that Abraxane s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for whom standard , anthracycline-containing therapy is not indicated .
The Committee recommended that Abraxane be given marketing authorisation .

What is Abraxane ?
Abraxane is a powder that is made up into a suspension for infusion ( drip into a vein ) .
It contains the active substance paclitaxel ( 5 mg/ ml ) .
What is Abraxane used for ?
Abraxane is used to treat metastatic breast cancer in patients whose first treatment for their metastatic disease has stopped working and for whom standard treatment including an anthracycline ( a type of anticancer medicine ) is not suitable . Metastatic means that the cancer has spread to other parts of the body .
Abraxane is used on its own .
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
How is Abraxane used ?
Abraxane should only be given under the supervision of a specialist cancer doctor in wards that are specialised in giving cytotoxic ( cell-killing ) medicines .
The recommended dose is 260 mg per square metre of body surface area ( calculated using the patient s height and weight ) .
It is given over a period of 30 minutes , every three weeks .
The dose may be reduced or treatment interrupted in patients who have certain side effects affecting the blood or the nerves .
Abraxane should not be used in patients who have severe problems with their liver .
The appropriate doses for patients with mild or moderate liver problems or with kidney problems are not known .
How does Abraxane work ?
The active substance in Abraxane , paclitaxel , belongs to the group of anticancer medicines known as the taxanes .
Paclitaxel blocks the ability of cancer cells to break down their internal skeleton that allows them to divide and multiply .
With their skeleton still in place , the cells cannot divide and they eventually die .
Abraxane also affects non-cancer cells such as blood and nerve cells , which can cause side effects .
Paclitaxel has been available as an anticancer medicine since 1993.
Conventional types of paclitaxel contain substances ( solvents ) that dissolve the paclitaxel , but can cause side effects .
Abraxane does not contain these solvents .

How has Abraxane been studied ?
The effects of Abraxane were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans .
The company also presented data from the published literature .
The effectiveness of Abraxane has been studied in one main study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , around three-quarters of whom had received an anthracycline in the past .
Around half of the patients in the study had already received treatments for their cancer after it had become metastatic .
The effects of Abraxane ( given on its own ) were compared with those of a conventional paclitaxel- containing medicine ( given together with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
The main measure of effectiveness was the number of patients who responded after at least five weeks of treatment .
This was defined as the patient s main tumours having disappeared or having shrunk in size by at least 30 % .
What benefit has Abraxane shown during the studies ?
Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel-containing medicines .
Overall , in the main study , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 women receiving Abraxane responded to treatment , compared with 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 receiving conventional paclitaxel-containing medicines .
When looking only at the patients who were receiving their first treatment for metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the medicines in terms of measures of effectiveness such as the time until the disease got worse and survival .
In contrast , in patients who had taken other treatments for metastatic breast cancer before , these additional measures showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel-containing medicines .
Therefore , the company withdrew its application for the use of Abraxane as first-line treatment during the assessment of the medicine .
What is the risk associated with Abraxane ?
The most common side effects with Abraxane ( seen in more than 1 patient in 10 ) are neutropenia ( low levels of neutrophils , a type of white blood cell ) , anaemia ( low red blood cell counts ) , leucopenia ( low levels of leucocytes , a type of white blood cell ) , thrombocytopenia ( low blood platelet counts ) , lymphopenia ( low levels of lymphocytes , a type of white blood cell ) , peripheral neuropathy ( nerve damage in the hands and feet ) , neuropathy ( nerve damage ) , hypoaesthesia ( reduced sense of touch ) , paraesthesia ( unusual sensations like pins and needles ) , nausea ( feeling sick ) , diarrhoea , vomiting , constipation , stomatitis ( inflammation of the lining of the mouth ) , alopecia ( hair loss ) , rash , arthralgia ( joint pain ) , myalgia ( muscle pain ) , anorexia ( loss of appetite ) , fatigue ( tiredness ) , asthenia ( weakness ) and pyrexia ( fever ) .

4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Abraxane monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for whom standard , anthracycline containing therapy is not indicated ( See also section 4.4 ) .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Abraxane should only be administered under the supervision of a qualified oncologist in units specialised in the administration of cytotoxic agents .
The procedure for reconstitution is described in section 6.6 .
The recommended dose of Abraxane is 260 mg/ m2 administered intravenously over 30 minutes every 3 weeks .
Dose adjustments during treatment :
Patients who experience severe neutropenia ( neutrophil count < 0.50 x 109/ l for a week or longer ) or severe sensory neuropathy during Abraxane therapy should have the dose reduced to 220 mg/ m2 for subsequent courses .
Following recurrence of severe neutropenia or severe sensory neuropathy , additional dose reduction should be made to 180 mg/ m2 .
Abraxane should not be administered until neutrophil counts recover to > 1.5 x 109/ l.
For grade 3 sensory neuropathy withhold treatment until resolution to grade 1 or 2 , followed by a dose reduction for all subsequent courses .
2 Patients with hepatic impairment :
Insufficient data are currently available to recommend dose modifications in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment ( see sections 4.4 . and 5.2 ) .
Patients with severe hepatic impairment should not be treated with paclitaxel .
Patients with impaired renal function :
Studies in patients with impaired renal function have not been performed and insufficient data are currently available to recommend dose modifications in patients with renal impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
Paediatric patients :
Abraxane is not recommended for use in children below age 18 years due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
Elderly patients :
In the clinical studies , no toxicities occurred notably more frequently among elderly patients who received Abraxane .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Lactation .
Patients who have baseline neutrophil counts < 1.5 x 109/ l.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Abraxane is an albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel , which may have substantially different pharmacological properties compared to other formulations of paclitaxel ( see sections 5.1 and 5.2). .
Hypersensitivity :
If hypersensitivity occurs , the medicinal product should be discontinued immediately , symptomatic treatment should be initiated , and that patient should not be rechallenged with paclitaxel .
Haematology :
Bone marrow suppression ( primarily neutropenia ) occurs frequently with Abraxane .
Neutropenia is dose-dependent and a dose-limiting toxicity .
Frequent monitoring of blood cell counts should be performed during Abraxane therapy .
Patients should not be retreated with subsequent cycles of Abraxane until neutrophils recover to > 1.5 x 109/ l and platelets recover to > 100 x 109/ l.
Neuropathy :
Sensory neuropathy occurs frequently with Abraxane , although development of severe symptoms is less common .
The occurrence of grade 1 or 2 sensory neuropathy does not generally require dose reduction .
If grade 3 sensory neuropathy develops , treatment should be withheld until resolution to grade 1 or 2 followed by a dose reduction for all subsequent courses of Abraxane is recommended ( see section 4.2 ) .
3 Hepatic Impairment :
Patients with hepatic impairment may be at increased risk of toxicity , particularly from myelosuppression , and such patients should be closely monitored for development of profound myelosuppression .
The use of Abraxane has not been formally studied in patients specifically with hepatic impairment .
Patients with severe hepatic impairment ( bilirubin > 5 x ULN or ASL/ ALT > 10 x ULN ) should not be treated with Abraxane .
The appropriate dose regimen in patients with less severe hepatic impairment is unknown .
Cardiotoxicity :
While cardiotoxicity unequivocally related to Abraxane has not been demonstrated , cardiac events are not uncommon in the indicated population , especially in patients who have previously received anthracyclines or have underlying cardiac or pulmonary disease .
Thus patients receiving Abraxane should be vigilantly monitored by physicians for the occurrence of cardiac events .
Sexually active men and women should use effective methods of contraception during treatment and up to six months after treatment for men , and one month after treatment for women ( see section 4.6 ) .
The effectiveness and safety of Abraxane in patients with central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases has not been established .
CNS metastases are generally not well controlled by systemic chemotherapy .
Gastrointestinal Symptoms :
If patients experience nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea following the administration of Abraxane , they may be treated with commonly used anti-emetics and constipating agents .
Excipients :
When reconstituted , Abraxane contains approximately 425 mg sodium per dose .
To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet .
4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed .
The metabolism of paclitaxel is catalysed , in part , by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 ( see section 5.2 ) .
Therefore , caution should be exercised when administering paclitaxel concomitantly with medicines known to inhibit ( e. g. erythromycin , fluoxetine , imidazole antifungals ) or induce ( e. g. rifampicin , carbamazepine , phenytoin , efavirenz , nevirapine ) either CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 .
Abraxane is indicated for mono-therapy .
Abraxane should not be used in combination with other anticancer agents .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy :
There are very limited data on the use of paclitaxel in human pregnancy .
Paclitaxel is suspected to cause serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy .
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
Abraxane should not be used in pregnancy , and in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception , unless the clinical condition of the mother requires treatment with paclitaxel .
4 Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during and up to 1 month after receiving treatment with Abraxane .
Male patients treated with Abraxane are advised not to father a child during and up to six months after treatment .
Lactation :
It is not known if paclitaxel is excreted in human milk .
Because of potential serious adverse reactions in breast-feeding infants , Abraxane is contraindicated during lactation .
Breastfeeding must be discontinued for the duration of therapy .
Fertility :
Abraxane induced infertility in male rats ( see section 5.3 ) .
Male patients should seek advice on conservation of sperm prior to treatment because of the possibility of irreversible infertility due to therapy with Abraxane .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abraxane has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
Abraxane may cause side effects such as tiredness ( very common ) and dizziness ( common ) that may affect the ability to drive and use machinery .
Patients should be advised not to drive and use machines if they feel tired or dizzy .
4.8 Undesirable effects
The following are the most common and important incidences of adverse reactions related to 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated with 260 mg/ m2 Abraxane once every three weeks in the pivotal phase III clinical study .

Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on one definitely related case in a population of 789 patients
Post-marketing experience
Cranial nerve palsies , vocal cord paresis , and rare reports of severe hypersensitivity reactions have been reported during post-marketing surveillance of Abraxane .
In some patients previously exposed to capecitabine , reports of palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesiae have been reported as part of the continuing surveillance of Abraxane .
Because these events have been reported voluntarily during clinical practice , true estimates of frequency cannot be made and a causal relationship to the events has not been established .
4.9 Overdose
There is no known antidote for paclitaxel overdose .
In the event of an overdose , the patient should be closely monitored .
Treatment should be directed at the major anticipated toxicities , which are bone marrow suppression , mucositis and peripheral neuropathy .

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group :
Taxanes , ATC Code :
L01CD01
Paclitaxel is an antimicrotubule agent that promotes the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilises microtubules by preventing depolymerisation .
This stability results in the inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubule network that is essential for vital interphase and mitotic cellular functions .
In addition , paclitaxel induces abnormal arrays or bundles of microtubules throughout the cell cycle and multiple asters of microtubules during mitosis .
Abraxane contains human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles .
Albumin is known to mediate endothelial transcytosis of plasma constituents and in vitro studies demonstrated that the presence of albumin enhances transport of paclitaxel across endothelial cells .
It is hypothesised that this enhanced transendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60 albumin receptor , and that there is accumulation of paclitaxel in the area of tumour due to the albumin-binding protein SPARC ( secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine ) .
Breast carcinoma :
Data from 106 patients accrued in two single-arm open-label studies and from 454 patients treated in a randomised Phase III comparative study are available to support the use of Abraxane in metastatic breast cancer .
This information is presented below .
Single-arm open-label studies
In one study , Abraxane was administered as a 30-minute infusion at a dose of 175 mg/ m2 to 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
The second trial utilised a dose of 300 mg/ m2 as a 30 minute infusion in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
Patients were treated without steroid pre- treatment or planned G-CSF support .
Cycles were administered at 3 week intervals .
The response rates in all patients were 39.5 % ( 95 % CI :
24.9 % - 54.2 % ) and 47.6 %
35,3 % - 60,0 % ) . 35.3 % - 60.0 % ) , respectively .
The median time to disease progression was 5.3 months ( 175 mg/ m2 ; 95 % CI :
4.6 6.2 months ) and 6.1 months ( 300 mg/ m2 ; 95 % CI :
4.2 9.8 months ) .
Randomised comparative study :
This multi-centre trial was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer , who were treated every 3 weeks with single-agent paclitaxel , either as solvent-based paclitaxel 175 mg/ m2 given as a 3-hour infusion with premedication to prevent hypersensitivity ( N = 225 ) , or as Abraxane 260 mg/ m2 given as a 30 minute infusion without premedication ( N = 229 ) .
Sixty-four percent of patients had impaired performance status ( ECOG 1 or 2 ) at study entry ; 79 % had visceral metastases ; and 76 % had > 3 sites of metastases .
Fourteen percent of the patients had not received prior chemotherapy ; 27 % had received chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting only , 40 % in the metastatic setting only , and 19 % in both metastatic and adjuvant settings .
Fifty-nine percent received study medicinal product as second or greater than second-line therapy .
Seventy-seven percent of the patients had been previously exposed to anthracyclines .
Results for overall response rate and time to disease progression , and progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving > 1st-line therapy , are shown below .

9 229 patients treated with Abraxane in the randomized , controlled clinical trial were evaluated for safety .
Neurotoxictiy to paclitaxel was evaluated through improvement by one grade for patients experiencing grade 3 peripheral neuropathy at any time during therapy .
The natural course of peripheral neuropathy to resolution to baseline due to cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after > 6 courses of treatment was not evaluated and remains unknown .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
The pharmacokinetics of total paclitaxel following 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane at dose levels of 80 to 375 mg/ m2 were determined in clinical studies .
The drug exposure ( AUC ) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng . hr/ ml following dosing from 80 to 300 mg/ m2 .
Following intravenous administration of Abraxane to patients with metastatic breast cancer at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg/ m2 , paclitaxel plasma concentrations declined in a multiphasic manner .
The mean Cmax of paclitaxel , which occurred at the end of the infusion , was 18.7 µg/ ml .
The mean total clearance was 15 l/ hr/ m2 .
The terminal half-life was about 27 hours .
The mean volume of distribution was 632 l/ m2 ; the large volume of distribution indicates extensive extravascular distribution and/ or tissue binding of paclitaxel .
In a study in patients with advanced solid tumours , the pharmacokinetic characteristics of paclitaxel following Abraxane administered intravenously at 260 mg/ m2 over 30 minutes were compared with those following 175 mg/ m2 of the solvent-based paclitaxel injection administered over 3 hours .
The clearance of paclitaxel with Abraxane was larger ( 43 % ) than that following a solvent-based paclitaxel injection and its volume of distribution was also higher ( 53 % ) .
Differences in Cmax and Cmax corrected for dose reflected differences in total dose and rate of infusion .
There were no differences in terminal half-lives .
The protein binding of paclitaxel following Abraxane administration is estimated at about 90 % .
Based on the published literature , in vitro studies of binding to human serum proteins , using paclitaxel at concentrations ranging from 0.03 to 1.2 µM , indicate that about 87 % of paclitaxel is bound ; the presence of ranitidine , dexamethasone , or diphenhydramine did not affect protein binding of paclitaxel .
Based on the published literature , in vitro studies with human liver microsomes and tissue slices show that paclitaxel is metabolised primarily to 6 -hydroxypaclitaxel ; and to two minor metabolites , 3 -p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6 -3 -p-dihydroxypaclitaxel .
The formation of these hydroxylated metabolites is catalysed by CYP2C8 , -3A4 , and both -2C8 and -3A4 respectively .
The effect of renal or hepatic dysfunction on the disposition of paclitaxel has not been formally investigated .
In patients with metastatic breast cancer , after a 30 minute infusion of Abraxane at 260 mg/ m2 , the mean value for cumulative urinary excretion of unchanged active substance accounted for 4 % of the total administered dose with less than 1 % as the metabolites 6 -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 -p-hydroxypaclitaxel , indicating extensive non-renal clearance .
Paclitaxel is principally eliminated by hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion .
Pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel in patients aged over 65 years seems comparable to that in patients less than 65 years .
However , little information in patients over 75 years is available as only 3 patients over 75 years of age where included in the pharmacokinetic analysis .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
The carcinogenic potential of paclitaxel has not been studied .
However , based on the published literature , paclitaxel is a potentially carcinogenic and genotoxic agent at clinical doses , based upon its pharmacodynamic mechanism of action .
Paclitaxel has been shown to be clastogenic in vitro ( chromosome aberrations in human lymphocytes ) and in vivo ( micronucleus test in mice ) .
Paclitaxel has been shown to be genotoxic in vivo ( micronucleus test in mice ) , but it did not induce mutagenicity
10 in the Ames test or the Chinese hamster ovary/ hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase ( CHO/ HGPRT ) gene mutation assay .
Paclitaxel at doses below the human therapeutic dose was associated with low fertility and foetal toxicity in rats .

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Abraxane monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for whom standard , anthracycline containing therapy is not indicated ( See also section 4.4 ) .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Abraxane should only be administered under the supervision of a qualified oncologist in units specialised in the administration of cytotoxic agents .
The procedure for reconstitution is described in section 6.6 .
The recommended dose of Abraxane is 260 mg/ m2 administered intravenously over 30 minutes every 3 weeks .
Dose adjustments during treatment :
Patients who experience severe neutropenia ( neutrophil count < 0.50 x 109/ l for a week or longer ) or severe sensory neuropathy during Abraxane therapy should have the dose reduced to 220 mg/ m2 for subsequent courses .
Following recurrence of severe neutropenia or severe sensory neuropathy , additional dose reduction should be made to 180 mg/ m2 .
Abraxane should not be administered until neutrophil counts recover to > 1.5 x 109/ l.
For grade 3 sensory neuropathy withhold treatment until resolution to grade 1 or 2 , followed by a dose reduction for all subsequent courses .
2 Patients with hepatic impairment :
Insufficient data are currently available to recommend dose modifications in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment ( see sections 4.4 . and 5.2 ) .
Patients with severe hepatic impairment should not be treated with paclitaxel .
Patients with impaired renal function :
Studies in patients with impaired renal function have not been performed and insufficient data are currently available to recommend dose modifications in patients with renal impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
Paediatric patients :
Abraxane is not recommended for use in children below age 18 years due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
Elderly patients :
In the clinical studies , no toxicities occurred notably more frequently among elderly patients who received Abraxane .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Lactation .
Patients who have baseline neutrophil counts < 1.5 x 109/ l.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Abraxane is an albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel , which may have substantially different pharmacological properties compared to other formulations of paclitaxel ( see sections 5.1 and 5.2). .
Hypersensitivity :
If hypersensitivity occurs , the medicinal product should be discontinued immediately , symptomatic treatment should be initiated , and that patient should not be rechallenged with paclitaxel .
Haematology :
Bone marrow suppression ( primarily neutropenia ) occurs frequently with Abraxane .
Neutropenia is dose-dependent and a dose-limiting toxicity .
Frequent monitoring of blood cell counts should be performed during Abraxane therapy .
Patients should not be retreated with subsequent cycles of Abraxane until neutrophils recover to > 1.5 x 109/ l and platelets recover to > 100 x 109/ l.
Neuropathy :
Sensory neuropathy occurs frequently with Abraxane , although development of severe symptoms is less common .
The occurrence of grade 1 or 2 sensory neuropathy does not generally require dose reduction .
If grade 3 sensory neuropathy develops , treatment should be withheld until resolution to grade 1 or 2 followed by a dose reduction for all subsequent courses of Abraxane is recommended ( see section 4.2 ) .
3 Hepatic Impairment :
Patients with hepatic impairment may be at increased risk of toxicity , particularly from myelosuppression , and such patients should be closely monitored for development of profound myelosuppression .
The use of Abraxane has not been formally studied in patients specifically with hepatic impairment .
Patients with severe hepatic impairment ( bilirubin > 5 x ULN or ASL/ ALT > 10 x ULN ) should not be treated with Abraxane .
The appropriate dose regimen in patients with less severe hepatic impairment is unknown .
Cardiotoxicity :
While cardiotoxicity unequivocally related to Abraxane has not been demonstrated , cardiac events are not uncommon in the indicated population , especially in patients who have previously received anthracyclines or have underlying cardiac or pulmonary disease .
Thus patients receiving Abraxane should be vigilantly monitored by physicians for the occurrence of cardiac events .
Sexually active men and women should use effective methods of contraception during treatment and up to six months after treatment for men , and one month after treatment for women ( see section 4.6 ) .
The effectiveness and safety of Abraxane in patients with central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases has not been established .
CNS metastases are generally not well controlled by systemic chemotherapy .
Gastrointestinal Symptoms :
If patients experience nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea following the administration of Abraxane , they may be treated with commonly used anti-emetics and constipating agents .
Excipients :
When reconstituted , Abraxane contains approximately 425 mg sodium per dose .
To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet .
4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed .
The metabolism of paclitaxel is catalysed , in part , by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 ( see section 5.2 ) .
Therefore , caution should be exercised when administering paclitaxel concomitantly with medicines known to inhibit ( e. g. erythromycin , fluoxetine , imidazole antifungals ) or induce ( e. g. rifampicin , carbamazepine , phenytoin , efavirenz , nevirapine ) either CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 .
Abraxane is indicated for mono-therapy .
Abraxane should not be used in combination with other anticancer agents .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy :
There are very limited data on the use of paclitaxel in human pregnancy .
Paclitaxel is suspected to cause serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy .
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
Abraxane should not be used in pregnancy , and in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception , unless the clinical condition of the mother requires treatment with paclitaxel .
4 Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during and up to 1 month after receiving treatment with Abraxane .
Male patients treated with Abraxane are advised not to father a child during and up to six months after treatment .
Lactation :
It is not known if paclitaxel is excreted in human milk .
Because of potential serious adverse reactions in breast-feeding infants , Abraxane is contraindicated during lactation .
Breastfeeding must be discontinued for the duration of therapy .
Fertility :
Abraxane induced infertility in male rats ( see section 5.3 ) .
Male patients should seek advice on conservation of sperm prior to treatment because of the possibility of irreversible infertility due to therapy with Abraxane .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abraxane has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
Abraxane may cause side effects such as tiredness ( very common ) and dizziness ( common ) that may affect the ability to drive and use machinery .
Patients should be advised not to drive and use machines if they feel tired or dizzy .
4.8 Undesirable effects
The following are the most common and important incidences of adverse reactions related to 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated with 260 mg/ m2 Abraxane once every three weeks in the pivotal phase III clinical study .

Uncommon :
Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on one definitely related case in a population of 789 patients
Post-marketing experience
Cranial nerve palsies , vocal cord paresis , and rare reports of severe hypersensitivity reactions have been reported during post-marketing surveillance of Abraxane .
In some patients previously exposed to capecitabine , reports of palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesiae have been reported as part of the continuing surveillance of Abraxane .
Because these events have been reported voluntarily during clinical practice , true estimates of frequency cannot be made and a causal relationship to the events has not been established .
4.9 Overdose
There is no known antidote for paclitaxel overdose .
In the event of an overdose , the patient should be closely monitored .
Treatment should be directed at the major anticipated toxicities , which are bone marrow suppression , mucositis and peripheral neuropathy .

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group :
Taxanes , ATC Code :
L01CD01
Paclitaxel is an antimicrotubule agent that promotes the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilises microtubules by preventing depolymerisation .
This stability results in the inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubule network that is essential for vital interphase and mitotic cellular functions .
In addition , paclitaxel induces abnormal arrays or bundles of microtubules throughout the cell cycle and multiple asters of microtubules during mitosis .
Abraxane contains human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles .
Albumin is known to mediate endothelial transcytosis of plasma constituents and in vitro studies demonstrated that the presence of albumin enhances transport of paclitaxel across endothelial cells .
It is hypothesised that this enhanced transendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60 albumin receptor , and that there is accumulation of paclitaxel in the area of tumour due to the albumin-binding protein SPARC ( secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine ) .
Breast carcinoma :
Data from 106 patients accrued in two single-arm open-label studies and from 454 patients treated in a randomised Phase III comparative study are available to support the use of Abraxane in metastatic breast cancer .
This information is presented below .
Single-arm open-label studies
In one study , Abraxane was administered as a 30-minute infusion at a dose of 175 mg/ m2 to 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
The second trial utilised a dose of 300 mg/ m2 as a 30 minute infusion in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
Patients were treated without steroid pre- treatment or planned G-CSF support .
Cycles were administered at 3 week intervals .
The response rates in all patients were 39.5 % ( 95 % CI :
24.9 % - 54.2 % ) and 47.6 %
35,3 % - 60,0 % ) . 35.3 % - 60.0 % ) , respectively .
The median time to disease progression was 5.3 months ( 175 mg/ m2 ; 95 % CI :
4.6 6.2 months ) and 6.1 months ( 300 mg/ m2 ; 95 % CI :
4.2 9.8 months ) .
Randomised comparative study :
This multi-centre trial was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer , who were treated every 3 weeks with single-agent paclitaxel , either as solvent-based paclitaxel 175 mg/ m2 given as a 3-hour infusion with premedication to prevent hypersensitivity ( N = 225 ) , or as Abraxane 260 mg/ m2 given as a 30 minute infusion without premedication ( N = 229 ) .
Sixty-four percent of patients had impaired performance status ( ECOG 1 or 2 ) at study entry ; 79 % had visceral metastases ; and 76 % had > 3 sites of metastases .
Fourteen percent of the patients had not received prior chemotherapy ; 27 % had received chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting only , 40 % in the metastatic setting only , and 19 % in both metastatic and adjuvant settings .
Fifty-nine percent received study medicinal product as second or greater than second-line therapy .
Seventy-seven percent of the patients had been previously exposed to anthracyclines .
Results for overall response rate and time to disease progression , and progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving > 1st-line therapy , are shown below .

* This data is based on Clinical Study Report :
CA012-0 Addendum dated Final ( 23 March-2005 ) a Chi-squared test b Log-rank test
9 229 patients treated with Abraxane in the randomized , controlled clinical trial were evaluated for safety .
Neurotoxictiy to paclitaxel was evaluated through improvement by one grade for patients experiencing grade 3 peripheral neuropathy at any time during therapy .
The natural course of peripheral neuropathy to resolution to baseline due to cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after > 6 courses of treatment was not evaluated and remains unknown .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
The pharmacokinetics of total paclitaxel following 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane at dose levels of 80 to 375 mg/ m2 were determined in clinical studies .
The drug exposure ( AUC ) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng . hr/ ml following dosing from 80 to 300 mg/ m2 .
Following intravenous administration of Abraxane to patients with metastatic breast cancer at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg/ m2 , paclitaxel plasma concentrations declined in a multiphasic manner .
The mean Cmax of paclitaxel , which occurred at the end of the infusion , was 18.7 µg/ ml .
The mean total clearance was 15 l/ hr/ m2 .
The terminal half-life was about 27 hours .
The mean volume of distribution was 632 l/ m2 ; the large volume of distribution indicates extensive extravascular distribution and/ or tissue binding of paclitaxel .
In a study in patients with advanced solid tumours , the pharmacokinetic characteristics of paclitaxel following Abraxane administered intravenously at 260 mg/ m2 over 30 minutes were compared with those following 175 mg/ m2 of the solvent-based paclitaxel injection administered over 3 hours .
The clearance of paclitaxel with Abraxane was larger ( 43 % ) than that following a solvent-based paclitaxel injection and its volume of distribution was also higher ( 53 % ) .
Differences in Cmax and Cmax corrected for dose reflected differences in total dose and rate of infusion .
There were no differences in terminal half-lives .
The protein binding of paclitaxel following Abraxane administration is estimated at about 90 % .
Based on the published literature , in vitro studies of binding to human serum proteins , using paclitaxel at concentrations ranging from 0.03 to 1.2 µM , indicate that about 87 % of paclitaxel is bound ; the presence of ranitidine , dexamethasone , or diphenhydramine did not affect protein binding of paclitaxel .
Based on the published literature , in vitro studies with human liver microsomes and tissue slices show that paclitaxel is metabolised primarily to 6 -hydroxypaclitaxel ; and to two minor metabolites , 3 -p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6 -3 -p-dihydroxypaclitaxel .
The formation of these hydroxylated metabolites is catalysed by CYP2C8 , -3A4 , and both -2C8 and -3A4 respectively .
The effect of renal or hepatic dysfunction on the disposition of paclitaxel has not been formally investigated .
In patients with metastatic breast cancer , after a 30 minute infusion of Abraxane at 260 mg/ m2 , the mean value for cumulative urinary excretion of unchanged active substance accounted for 4 % of the total administered dose with less than 1 % as the metabolites 6 -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 -p-hydroxypaclitaxel , indicating extensive non-renal clearance .
Paclitaxel is principally eliminated by hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion .
Pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel in patients aged over 65 years seems comparable to that in patients less than 65 years .
However , little information in patients over 75 years is available as only 3 patients over 75 years of age where included in the pharmacokinetic analysis .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
The carcinogenic potential of paclitaxel has not been studied .
However , based on the published literature , paclitaxel is a potentially carcinogenic and genotoxic agent at clinical doses , based upon its pharmacodynamic mechanism of action .
Paclitaxel has been shown to be clastogenic in vitro ( chromosome aberrations in human lymphocytes ) and in vivo ( micronucleus test in mice ) .
Paclitaxel has been shown to be genotoxic in vivo ( micronucleus test in mice ) , but it did not induce mutagenicity
10 in the Ames test or the Chinese hamster ovary/ hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase ( CHO/ HGPRT ) gene mutation assay .
Paclitaxel at doses below the human therapeutic dose was associated with low fertility and foetal toxicity in rats .

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Abraxane monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for whom standard , anthracycline containing therapy is not indicated ( See also section 4.4 ) .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Abraxane should only be administered under the supervision of a qualified oncologist in units specialised in the administration of cytotoxic agents .
The procedure for reconstitution is described in section 6.6 .
The recommended dose of Abraxane is 260 mg/ m2 administered intravenously over 30 minutes every 3 weeks .
Dose adjustments during treatment :
Patients who experience severe neutropenia ( neutrophil count < 0.50 x 109/ l for a week or longer ) or severe sensory neuropathy during Abraxane therapy should have the dose reduced to 220 mg/ m2 for subsequent courses .
Following recurrence of severe neutropenia or severe sensory neuropathy , additional dose reduction should be made to 180 mg/ m2 .
Abraxane should not be administered until neutrophil counts recover to > 1.5 x 109/ l.
For grade 3 sensory neuropathy withhold treatment until resolution to grade 1 or 2 , followed by a dose reduction for all subsequent courses .
2 Patients with hepatic impairment :
Insufficient data are currently available to recommend dose modifications in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment ( see sections 4.4 . and 5.2 ) .
Patients with severe hepatic impairment should not be treated with paclitaxel .
Patients with impaired renal function :
Studies in patients with impaired renal function have not been performed and insufficient data are currently available to recommend dose modifications in patients with renal impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
Paediatric patients :
Abraxane is not recommended for use in children below age 18 years due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
Elderly patients :
In the clinical studies , no toxicities occurred notably more frequently among elderly patients who received Abraxane .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Lactation .
Patients who have baseline neutrophil counts < 1.5 x 109/ l.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Abraxane is an albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel , which may have substantially different pharmacological properties compared to other formulations of paclitaxel ( see sections 5.1 and 5.2). .
Hypersensitivity :
If hypersensitivity occurs , the medicinal product should be discontinued immediately , symptomatic treatment should be initiated , and that patient should not be rechallenged with paclitaxel .
Haematology :
Bone marrow suppression ( primarily neutropenia ) occurs frequently with Abraxane .
Neutropenia is dose-dependent and a dose-limiting toxicity .
Frequent monitoring of blood cell counts should be performed during Abraxane therapy .
Patients should not be retreated with subsequent cycles of Abraxane until neutrophils recover to > 1.5 x 109/ l and platelets recover to > 100 x 109/ l.
Neuropathy :
Sensory neuropathy occurs frequently with Abraxane , although development of severe symptoms is less common .
The occurrence of grade 1 or 2 sensory neuropathy does not generally require dose reduction .
If grade 3 sensory neuropathy develops , treatment should be withheld until resolution to grade 1 or 2 followed by a dose reduction for all subsequent courses of Abraxane is recommended ( see section 4.2 ) .
3 Hepatic Impairment :
Patients with hepatic impairment may be at increased risk of toxicity , particularly from myelosuppression , and such patients should be closely monitored for development of profound myelosuppression .
The use of Abraxane has not been formally studied in patients specifically with hepatic impairment .
Patients with severe hepatic impairment ( bilirubin > 5 x ULN or ASL/ ALT > 10 x ULN ) should not be treated with Abraxane .
The appropriate dose regimen in patients with less severe hepatic impairment is unknown .
Cardiotoxicity :
While cardiotoxicity unequivocally related to Abraxane has not been demonstrated , cardiac events are not uncommon in the indicated population , especially in patients who have previously received anthracyclines or have underlying cardiac or pulmonary disease .
Thus patients receiving Abraxane should be vigilantly monitored by physicians for the occurrence of cardiac events .
Sexually active men and women should use effective methods of contraception during treatment and up to six months after treatment for men , and one month after treatment for women ( see section 4.6 ) .
The effectiveness and safety of Abraxane in patients with central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases has not been established .
CNS metastases are generally not well controlled by systemic chemotherapy .
Gastrointestinal Symptoms :
If patients experience nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea following the administration of Abraxane , they may be treated with commonly used anti-emetics and constipating agents .
Excipients :
When reconstituted , Abraxane contains approximately 425 mg sodium per dose .
To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet .
4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed .
The metabolism of paclitaxel is catalysed , in part , by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 ( see section 5.2 ) .
Therefore , caution should be exercised when administering paclitaxel concomitantly with medicines known to inhibit ( e. g. erythromycin , fluoxetine , imidazole antifungals ) or induce ( e. g. rifampicin , carbamazepine , phenytoin , efavirenz , nevirapine ) either CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 .
Abraxane is indicated for mono-therapy .
Abraxane should not be used in combination with other anticancer agents .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy :
There are very limited data on the use of paclitaxel in human pregnancy .
Paclitaxel is suspected to cause serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy .
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
Abraxane should not be used in pregnancy , and in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception , unless the clinical condition of the mother requires treatment with paclitaxel .
4 Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during and up to 1 month after receiving treatment with Abraxane .
Male patients treated with Abraxane are advised not to father a child during and up to six months after treatment .
Lactation :
It is not known if paclitaxel is excreted in human milk .
Because of potential serious adverse reactions in breast-feeding infants , Abraxane is contraindicated during lactation .
Breastfeeding must be discontinued for the duration of therapy .
Fertility :
Abraxane induced infertility in male rats ( see section 5.3 ) .
Male patients should seek advice on conservation of sperm prior to treatment because of the possibility of irreversible infertility due to therapy with Abraxane .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abraxane has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
Abraxane may cause side effects such as tiredness ( very common ) and dizziness ( common ) that may affect the ability to drive and use machinery .
Patients should be advised not to drive and use machines if they feel tired or dizzy .
4.8 Undesirable effects

Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on one definitely related case in a population of 789 patients
Post-marketing experience
Cranial nerve palsies , vocal cord paresis , and rare reports of severe hypersensitivity reactions have been reported during post-marketing surveillance of Abraxane .
In some patients previously exposed to capecitabine , reports of palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesiae have been reported as part of the continuing surveillance of Abraxane .
Because these events have been reported voluntarily during clinical practice , true estimates of frequency cannot be made and a causal relationship to the events has not been established .
4.9 Overdose
There is no known antidote for paclitaxel overdose .
In the event of an overdose , the patient should be closely monitored .
Treatment should be directed at the major anticipated toxicities , which are bone marrow suppression , mucositis and peripheral neuropathy .

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group :
Taxanes , ATC Code :
L01CD01
Paclitaxel is an antimicrotubule agent that promotes the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilises microtubules by preventing depolymerisation .
This stability results in the inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubule network that is essential for vital interphase and mitotic cellular functions .
In addition , paclitaxel induces abnormal arrays or bundles of microtubules throughout the cell cycle and multiple asters of microtubules during mitosis .
Abraxane contains human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles .
Albumin is known to mediate endothelial transcytosis of plasma constituents and in vitro studies demonstrated that the presence of albumin enhances transport of paclitaxel across endothelial cells .
It is hypothesised that this enhanced transendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60 albumin receptor , and that there is accumulation of paclitaxel in the area of tumour due to the albumin-binding protein SPARC ( secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine ) .
Breast carcinoma :
Data from 106 patients accrued in two single-arm open-label studies and from 454 patients treated in a randomised Phase III comparative study are available to support the use of Abraxane in metastatic breast cancer .
This information is presented below .
Single-arm open-label studies
In one study , Abraxane was administered as a 30-minute infusion at a dose of 175 mg/ m2 to 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
The second trial utilised a dose of 300 mg/ m2 as a 30 minute infusion in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
Patients were treated without steroid pre- treatment or planned G-CSF support .
Cycles were administered at 3 week intervals .
The response rates in all patients were 39.5 % ( 95 % CI :
24.9 % - 54.2 % ) and 47.6 %
35,3 % - 60,0 % ) . 35.3 % - 60.0 % ) , respectively .
The median time to disease progression was 5.3 months ( 175 mg/ m2 ; 95 % CI :
4.6 6.2 months ) and 6.1 months ( 300 mg/ m2 ; 95 % CI :
4.2 9.8 months ) .
Randomised comparative study :
This multi-centre trial was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer , who were treated every 3 weeks with single-agent paclitaxel , either as solvent-based paclitaxel 175 mg/ m2 given as a 3-hour infusion with premedication to prevent hypersensitivity ( N = 225 ) , or as Abraxane 260 mg/ m2 given as a 30 minute infusion without premedication ( N = 229 ) .
Sixty-four percent of patients had impaired performance status ( ECOG 1 or 2 ) at study entry ; 79 % had visceral metastases ; and 76 % had > 3 sites of metastases .
Fourteen percent of the patients had not received prior chemotherapy ; 27 % had received chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting only , 40 % in the metastatic setting only , and 19 % in both metastatic and adjuvant settings .
Fifty-nine percent received study medicinal product as second or greater than second-line therapy .
Seventy-seven percent of the patients had been previously exposed to anthracyclines .
Results for overall response rate and time to disease progression , and progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving > 1st-line therapy , are shown below .

9 229 patients treated with Abraxane in the randomized , controlled clinical trial were evaluated for safety .
Neurotoxictiy to paclitaxel was evaluated through improvement by one grade for patients experiencing grade 3 peripheral neuropathy at any time during therapy .
The natural course of peripheral neuropathy to resolution to baseline due to cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after > 6 courses of treatment was not evaluated and remains unknown .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
The pharmacokinetics of total paclitaxel following 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane at dose levels of 80 to 375 mg/ m2 were determined in clinical studies .
The drug exposure ( AUC ) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng . hr/ ml following dosing from 80 to 300 mg/ m2 .
Following intravenous administration of Abraxane to patients with metastatic breast cancer at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg/ m2 , paclitaxel plasma concentrations declined in a multiphasic manner .
The mean Cmax of paclitaxel , which occurred at the end of the infusion , was 18.7 µg/ ml .
The mean total clearance was 15 l/ hr/ m2 .
The terminal half-life was about 27 hours .
The mean volume of distribution was 632 l/ m2 ; the large volume of distribution indicates extensive extravascular distribution and/ or tissue binding of paclitaxel .
In a study in patients with advanced solid tumours , the pharmacokinetic characteristics of paclitaxel following Abraxane administered intravenously at 260 mg/ m2 over 30 minutes were compared with those following 175 mg/ m2 of the solvent-based paclitaxel injection administered over 3 hours .
The clearance of paclitaxel with Abraxane was larger ( 43 % ) than that following a solvent-based paclitaxel injection and its volume of distribution was also higher ( 53 % ) .
Differences in Cmax and Cmax corrected for dose reflected differences in total dose and rate of infusion .
There were no differences in terminal half-lives .
The protein binding of paclitaxel following Abraxane administration is estimated at about 90 % .
Based on the published literature , in vitro studies of binding to human serum proteins , using paclitaxel at concentrations ranging from 0.03 to 1.2 µM , indicate that about 87 % of paclitaxel is bound ; the presence of ranitidine , dexamethasone , or diphenhydramine did not affect protein binding of paclitaxel .
Based on the published literature , in vitro studies with human liver microsomes and tissue slices show that paclitaxel is metabolised primarily to 6 -hydroxypaclitaxel ; and to two minor metabolites , 3 -p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6 -3 -p-dihydroxypaclitaxel .
The formation of these hydroxylated metabolites is catalysed by CYP2C8 , -3A4 , and both -2C8 and -3A4 respectively .
The effect of renal or hepatic dysfunction on the disposition of paclitaxel has not been formally investigated .
In patients with metastatic breast cancer , after a 30 minute infusion of Abraxane at 260 mg/ m2 , the mean value for cumulative urinary excretion of unchanged active substance accounted for 4 % of the total administered dose with less than 1 % as the metabolites 6 -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 -p-hydroxypaclitaxel , indicating extensive non-renal clearance .
Paclitaxel is principally eliminated by hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion .
Pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel in patients aged over 65 years seems comparable to that in patients less than 65 years .
However , little information in patients over 75 years is available as only 3 patients over 75 years of age where included in the pharmacokinetic analysis .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
The carcinogenic potential of paclitaxel has not been studied .
However , based on the published literature , paclitaxel is a potentially carcinogenic and genotoxic agent at clinical doses , based upon its pharmacodynamic mechanism of action .
Paclitaxel has been shown to be clastogenic in vitro ( chromosome aberrations in human lymphocytes ) and in vivo ( micronucleus test in mice ) .
Paclitaxel has been shown to be genotoxic in vivo ( micronucleus test in mice ) , but it did not induce mutagenicity
10 in the Ames test or the Chinese hamster ovary/ hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase ( CHO/ HGPRT ) gene mutation assay .
Paclitaxel at doses below the human therapeutic dose was associated with low fertility and foetal toxicity in rats .

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Abraxane monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for whom standard , anthracycline containing therapy is not indicated ( See also section 4.4 ) .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Abraxane should only be administered under the supervision of a qualified oncologist in units specialised in the administration of cytotoxic agents .
The procedure for reconstitution is described in section 6.6 .
The recommended dose of Abraxane is 260 mg/ m2 administered intravenously over 30 minutes every 3 weeks .
Dose adjustments during treatment :
Patients who experience severe neutropenia ( neutrophil count < 0.50 x 109/ l for a week or longer ) or severe sensory neuropathy during Abraxane therapy should have the dose reduced to 220 mg/ m2 for subsequent courses .
Following recurrence of severe neutropenia or severe sensory neuropathy , additional dose reduction should be made to 180 mg/ m2 .
Abraxane should not be administered until neutrophil counts recover to > 1.5 x 109/ l.
For grade 3 sensory neuropathy withhold treatment until resolution to grade 1 or 2 , followed by a dose reduction for all subsequent courses .
2 Patients with hepatic impairment :
Insufficient data are currently available to recommend dose modifications in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment ( see sections 4.4 . and 5.2 ) .
Patients with severe hepatic impairment should not be treated with paclitaxel .
Patients with impaired renal function :
Studies in patients with impaired renal function have not been performed and insufficient data are currently available to recommend dose modifications in patients with renal impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
Paediatric patients :
Abraxane is not recommended for use in children below age 18 years due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
Elderly patients :
In the clinical studies , no toxicities occurred notably more frequently among elderly patients who received Abraxane .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Lactation .
Patients who have baseline neutrophil counts < 1.5 x 109/ l.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Abraxane is an albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel , which may have substantially different pharmacological properties compared to other formulations of paclitaxel ( see sections 5.1 and 5.2). .
Hypersensitivity :
If hypersensitivity occurs , the medicinal product should be discontinued immediately , symptomatic treatment should be initiated , and that patient should not be rechallenged with paclitaxel .
Haematology :
Bone marrow suppression ( primarily neutropenia ) occurs frequently with Abraxane .
Neutropenia is dose-dependent and a dose-limiting toxicity .
Frequent monitoring of blood cell counts should be performed during Abraxane therapy .
Patients should not be retreated with subsequent cycles of Abraxane until neutrophils recover to > 1.5 x 109/ l and platelets recover to > 100 x 109/ l.
Neuropathy :
Sensory neuropathy occurs frequently with Abraxane , although development of severe symptoms is less common .
The occurrence of grade 1 or 2 sensory neuropathy does not generally require dose reduction .
If grade 3 sensory neuropathy develops , treatment should be withheld until resolution to grade 1 or 2 followed by a dose reduction for all subsequent courses of Abraxane is recommended ( see section 4.2 ) .
3 Hepatic Impairment :
Patients with hepatic impairment may be at increased risk of toxicity , particularly from myelosuppression , and such patients should be closely monitored for development of profound myelosuppression .
The use of Abraxane has not been formally studied in patients specifically with hepatic impairment .
Patients with severe hepatic impairment ( bilirubin > 5 x ULN or ASL/ ALT > 10 x ULN ) should not be treated with Abraxane .
The appropriate dose regimen in patients with less severe hepatic impairment is unknown .
Cardiotoxicity :
While cardiotoxicity unequivocally related to Abraxane has not been demonstrated , cardiac events are not uncommon in the indicated population , especially in patients who have previously received anthracyclines or have underlying cardiac or pulmonary disease .
Thus patients receiving Abraxane should be vigilantly monitored by physicians for the occurrence of cardiac events .
Sexually active men and women should use effective methods of contraception during treatment and up to six months after treatment for men , and one month after treatment for women ( see section 4.6 ) .
The effectiveness and safety of Abraxane in patients with central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases has not been established .
CNS metastases are generally not well controlled by systemic chemotherapy .
Gastrointestinal Symptoms :
If patients experience nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea following the administration of Abraxane , they may be treated with commonly used anti-emetics and constipating agents .
Excipients :
When reconstituted , Abraxane contains approximately 425 mg sodium per dose .
To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet .
4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed .
The metabolism of paclitaxel is catalysed , in part , by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 ( see section 5.2 ) .
Therefore , caution should be exercised when administering paclitaxel concomitantly with medicines known to inhibit ( e. g. erythromycin , fluoxetine , imidazole antifungals ) or induce ( e. g. rifampicin , carbamazepine , phenytoin , efavirenz , nevirapine ) either CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 .
Abraxane is indicated for mono-therapy .
Abraxane should not be used in combination with other anticancer agents .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy :
There are very limited data on the use of paclitaxel in human pregnancy .
Paclitaxel is suspected to cause serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy .
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
Abraxane should not be used in pregnancy , and in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception , unless the clinical condition of the mother requires treatment with paclitaxel .
4 Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during and up to 1 month after receiving treatment with Abraxane .
Male patients treated with Abraxane are advised not to father a child during and up to six months after treatment .
Lactation :
It is not known if paclitaxel is excreted in human milk .
Because of potential serious adverse reactions in breast-feeding infants , Abraxane is contraindicated during lactation .
Breastfeeding must be discontinued for the duration of therapy .
Fertility :
Abraxane induced infertility in male rats ( see section 5.3 ) .
Male patients should seek advice on conservation of sperm prior to treatment because of the possibility of irreversible infertility due to therapy with Abraxane .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abraxane has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
Abraxane may cause side effects such as tiredness ( very common ) and dizziness ( common ) that may affect the ability to drive and use machinery .
Patients should be advised not to drive and use machines if they feel tired or dizzy .
4.8 Undesirable effects
The following are the most common and important incidences of adverse reactions related to 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated with 260 mg/ m2 Abraxane once every three weeks in the pivotal phase III clinical study .

Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on one definitely related case in a population of 789 patients
Post-marketing experience
Cranial nerve palsies , vocal cord paresis , and rare reports of severe hypersensitivity reactions have been reported during post-marketing surveillance of Abraxane .
In some patients previously exposed to capecitabine , reports of palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesiae have been reported as part of the continuing surveillance of Abraxane .
Because these events have been reported voluntarily during clinical practice , true estimates of frequency cannot be made and a causal relationship to the events has not been established .
4.9 Overdose
There is no known antidote for paclitaxel overdose .
In the event of an overdose , the patient should be closely monitored .
Treatment should be directed at the major anticipated toxicities , which are bone marrow suppression , mucositis and peripheral neuropathy .
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group :
Taxanes , ATC Code :
L01CD01
Paclitaxel is an antimicrotubule agent that promotes the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilises microtubules by preventing depolymerisation .
This stability results in the inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubule network that is essential for vital interphase and mitotic cellular functions .
In addition , paclitaxel induces abnormal arrays or bundles of microtubules throughout the cell cycle and multiple asters of microtubules during mitosis .
Abraxane contains human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles .
Albumin is known to mediate endothelial transcytosis of plasma constituents and in vitro studies demonstrated that the presence of albumin enhances transport of paclitaxel across endothelial cells .
It is hypothesised that this enhanced transendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60 albumin receptor , and that there is accumulation of paclitaxel in the area of tumour due to the albumin-binding protein SPARC ( secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine ) .
Breast carcinoma :
Data from 106 patients accrued in two single-arm open-label studies and from 454 patients treated in a randomised Phase III comparative study are available to support the use of Abraxane in metastatic breast cancer .
This information is presented below .
Single-arm open-label studies
In one study , Abraxane was administered as a 30-minute infusion at a dose of 175 mg/ m2 to 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
The second trial utilised a dose of 300 mg/ m2 as a 30 minute infusion in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
Patients were treated without steroid pre- treatment or planned G-CSF support .
Cycles were administered at 3 week intervals .
The response rates in all patients were 39.5 % ( 95 % CI :
24.9 % - 54.2 % ) and 47.6 %
35,3 % - 60,0 % ) . 35.3 % - 60.0 % ) , respectively .
The median time to disease progression was 5.3 months ( 175 mg/ m2 ; 95 % CI :
4.6 6.2 months ) and 6.1 months ( 300 mg/ m2 ; 95 % CI :
4.2 9.8 months ) .
Randomised comparative study :
This multi-centre trial was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer , who were treated every 3 weeks with single-agent paclitaxel , either as solvent-based paclitaxel 175 mg/ m2 given as a 3-hour infusion with premedication to prevent hypersensitivity ( N = 225 ) , or as Abraxane 260 mg/ m2 given as a 30 minute infusion without premedication ( N = 229 ) .
Sixty-four percent of patients had impaired performance status ( ECOG 1 or 2 ) at study entry ; 79 % had visceral metastases ; and 76 % had > 3 sites of metastases .
Fourteen percent of the patients had not received prior chemotherapy ; 27 % had received chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting only , 40 % in the metastatic setting only , and 19 % in both metastatic and adjuvant settings .
Fifty-nine percent received study medicinal product as second or greater than second-line therapy .
Seventy-seven percent of the patients had been previously exposed to anthracyclines .
Results for overall response rate and time to disease progression , and progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving > 1st-line therapy , are shown below .

9 229 patients treated with Abraxane in the randomized , controlled clinical trial were evaluated for safety .
Neurotoxictiy to paclitaxel was evaluated through improvement by one grade for patients experiencing grade 3 peripheral neuropathy at any time during therapy .
The natural course of peripheral neuropathy to resolution to baseline due to cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after > 6 courses of treatment was not evaluated and remains unknown .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
The pharmacokinetics of total paclitaxel following 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane at dose levels of 80 to 375 mg/ m2 were determined in clinical studies .
The drug exposure ( AUC ) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng . hr/ ml following dosing from 80 to 300 mg/ m2 .
Following intravenous administration of Abraxane to patients with metastatic breast cancer at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg/ m2 , paclitaxel plasma concentrations declined in a multiphasic manner .
The mean Cmax of paclitaxel , which occurred at the end of the infusion , was 18.7 µg/ ml .
The mean total clearance was 15 l/ hr/ m2 .
The terminal half-life was about 27 hours .
The mean volume of distribution was 632 l/ m2 ; the large volume of distribution indicates extensive extravascular distribution and/ or tissue binding of paclitaxel .
In a study in patients with advanced solid tumours , the pharmacokinetic characteristics of paclitaxel following Abraxane administered intravenously at 260 mg/ m2 over 30 minutes were compared with those following 175 mg/ m2 of the solvent-based paclitaxel injection administered over 3 hours .
The clearance of paclitaxel with Abraxane was larger ( 43 % ) than that following a solvent-based paclitaxel injection and its volume of distribution was also higher ( 53 % ) .
Differences in Cmax and Cmax corrected for dose reflected differences in total dose and rate of infusion .
There were no differences in terminal half-lives .
The protein binding of paclitaxel following Abraxane administration is estimated at about 90 % .
Based on the published literature , in vitro studies of binding to human serum proteins , using paclitaxel at concentrations ranging from 0.03 to 1.2 µM , indicate that about 87 % of paclitaxel is bound ; the presence of ranitidine , dexamethasone , or diphenhydramine did not affect protein binding of paclitaxel .
Based on the published literature , in vitro studies with human liver microsomes and tissue slices show that paclitaxel is metabolised primarily to 6 -hydroxypaclitaxel ; and to two minor metabolites , 3 -p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6 -3 -p-dihydroxypaclitaxel .
The formation of these hydroxylated metabolites is catalysed by CYP2C8 , -3A4 , and both -2C8 and -3A4 respectively .
The effect of renal or hepatic dysfunction on the disposition of paclitaxel has not been formally investigated .
In patients with metastatic breast cancer , after a 30 minute infusion of Abraxane at 260 mg/ m2 , the mean value for cumulative urinary excretion of unchanged active substance accounted for 4 % of the total administered dose with less than 1 % as the metabolites 6 -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 -p-hydroxypaclitaxel , indicating extensive non-renal clearance .
Paclitaxel is principally eliminated by hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion .
Pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel in patients aged over 65 years seems comparable to that in patients less than 65 years .
However , little information in patients over 75 years is available as only 3 patients over 75 years of age where included in the pharmacokinetic analysis .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
The carcinogenic potential of paclitaxel has not been studied .
However , based on the published literature , paclitaxel is a potentially carcinogenic and genotoxic agent at clinical doses , based upon its pharmacodynamic mechanism of action .
Paclitaxel has been shown to be clastogenic in vitro ( chromosome aberrations in human lymphocytes ) and in vivo ( micronucleus test in mice ) .
Paclitaxel has been shown to be genotoxic in vivo ( micronucleus test in mice ) , but it did not induce mutagenicity
10 in the Ames test or the Chinese hamster ovary/ hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase ( CHO/ HGPRT ) gene mutation assay .
Paclitaxel at doses below the human therapeutic dose was associated with low fertility and foetal toxicity in rats .

11 Reconstitution and administration of the product :
Abraxane is supplied as a sterile lyophilised powder for reconstitution before use .
After reconstitution , each ml of suspension contains 5 mg of paclitaxel .
Using a sterile syringe , 20 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ ml ( 0.9 % ) solution for infusion should slowly be injected into a vial of Abraxane over a minimum of 1 minute .
The solution should be directed onto the inside wall of the vial .
The solution should not be injected directly onto the powder as this will result in foaming .
Once the addition is complete , the vial should be allowed to stand for a minimum of 5 minutes to ensure proper wetting of the solid .
Then , the vial should gently and slowly be swirled and/ or inverted for at least 2 minutes until complete resuspension of any powder occurs .
The generation of foam must be avoided .
If foaming or clumping occurs , the solution must stand for at least 15 minutes until foam subsides .
The reconstituted suspension should be milky and homogenous without visible precipitates .
If precipitates or settling are visible , the vial should be gently inverted again to ensure complete resuspension prior to use .
Some settling of the reconstituted suspension may occur .
Complete resuspension should be ensured by mild agitation before use .
Discard the reconstituted suspension if precipitates are observed .
Calculate the exact total dosing volume of 5 mg/ ml suspension required for the patient and inject the appropriate amount of reconstituted Abraxane into an empty , sterile , PVC or non-PVC type intravenous bag .
The use of specialized DEHP-free solution containers or administration sets is not necessary to prepare or administer Abraxane infusions .
In-line filters should not be used .
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements .
