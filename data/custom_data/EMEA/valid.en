CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Oral use .
Schizophrenia :
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals .
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/ day .
Enhanced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Manic episodes :
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals as monotherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Recurrence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder :
For preventing recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have been receiving aripiprazole , continue therapy at the same dose .
Adjustments of daily dosage , including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status .
Children and adolescents : there is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age .
Patients with hepatic impairment : no dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment .
In patients with severe hepatic impairment , the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations .
Bei diesen Patienten sollte die Dosierung vorsichtig eingestellt werden . However , the
2 maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
Patients with renal impairment : no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment .
Elderly : the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patients 65 years of age or older has not been established .
Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population , a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
Gender : no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients ( see section 5.2 ) .
Smoking status : according to the metabolic pathway of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment is required for smokers ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be reduced .
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy , aripiprazole dose should then be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be increased .
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy , the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
During antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient 's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period .
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , including treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
Close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany antipsychotic therapy .
Results of an epidemiological study found that there was no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder .
Cardiovascular disorders :
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , heart failure , or conduction abnormalities ) , cerebrovascular disease , conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , and treatment with antihypertensive medications ) or hypertension , including accelerated or malignant .
Conduction abnormalities :
In clinical trials of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo .
As with other antipsychotics , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation .
Tardive Dyskinesia : in clinical trials of one year or less duration , there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY , dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) :
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products .
In clinical trials , rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Klinische Manifestationen eines MNS sind hohes Fieber , Muskelrigidität , wechselnde Bewusstseinslagen und Anzeichen autonomer Instabilität ( unregelmäßiger Puls oder Blutdruck , Tachykardie , Schwitzen und Herzrhythmusstörungen ) . 3 mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
However , elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , not necessarily in association with NMS , have also been reported .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including ABILIFY , must be discontinued .
Seizure : in clinical trials , uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Therefore , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizures .
Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis :
Increased mortality : in three placebo-controlled trials ( n= 938 ; mean age :
82.4 years ; range :
56-99 years ) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer 's disease , patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo .
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
Although the causes of deaths were varied , most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular ( e. g. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( e. g. pneumonia ) in nature .
Cerebrovascular adverse events : in the same trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( e. g. stroke , transient ischaemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported in patients ( mean age :
84 years ; range :
78-88 years ) .
Overall , 1.3 % of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patients in these trials .
This difference was not statistically significant .
However , in one of these trials , a fixed-dose trial , there was a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
Hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus : hyperglycaemia , in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY .
Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabetes .
In clinical trials with aripiprazole , there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events ( including diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo .
Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to allow direct comparisons .
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY , should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia ( such as polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control .
Weight gain : weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co- morbidities , use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain , poorly managed life-style , and might lead to severe complications .
Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY .
When seen , it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma .
In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
Dysphagia : oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use , including ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
Lactose : patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product .
Hypersensitivity : as with other medications hypersensitivity reactions , characterised by allergic symptoms , may occur with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
4 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents .
Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole , caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping undesirable effects such as sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicines known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance , caution should be used .
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY :
A gastric acid blocker , the H2 antagonist famotidine , reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes .
Thus , no dosage adjustment is required for smokers .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax was unchanged .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , decreased by 32 % and 47 % .
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 , such as fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY , potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient .
When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs , ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 , such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .
When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 ( e. g. , diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY , modest increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expected .
Following concomitant administration of carbamazepine , a potent inducer of CYP3A4 , the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower , respectively , compared to when aripiprazole ( 30 mg ) was administered alone .
Similarly , for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower , respectively , than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone .
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine .
Es ist zu erwarten , dass andere hochwirksame Induktoren von CYP3A4 ( wie Rifampicin , Rifabutin , Phenytoin , Phenobarbital , Primidon , Efavirenz , Nevirapin und Johanniskraut ) ähnliche Wirkungen haben und deshalb sollten ähnliche Dosiserhöhungen vorgenommen werden . John 's Wort ) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose .
5 When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole , there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations .
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products :
In clinical studies , 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
Additionally , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro .
Thus , aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these enzymes .
When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women .
Animal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by animal reproductive studies , this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole was excreted in the milk of treated rats during lactation .
Da nicht bekannt ist , ob Aripiprazol beim Menschen in die Milch ausgeschieden wird , sollte den Patientinnen geraten werden , während der Einnahme von Aripiprazol nicht zu stillen . Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
However , as with other antipsychotics , patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adversely .
4.8 Undesirable effects

6 Extrapyramidal symptoms ( EPS ) :
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial , aripiprazole-treated patients had an overall-lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS including parkinsonism , akathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patients .
In another long-term 26-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patients .
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 23.5 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patients .
In another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated with lithium .
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patients .
In placebo-controlled trials , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
