COUNCIL DIRECTIVE of 19 December 1972 on taxes other than turnover taxes which affect the consumption of manufactured tobacco ( 72 / 464 / EEC )
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community and in particular Articles 99 and 100 thereof ,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission ,
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament ,
Having regard to the Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee ,
Whereas the objective of the Treaty is to establish an economic union within which there is healthy competition and whose characteristics are similar to those of a domestic market ; and , as regards manufactured tobacco , achievement of this aim presupposes that the application in the Member States of taxes affecting the consumption of products in this sector does not distort conditions of competition and does not impede their free movement within the Community ;
Whereas the taxes which at present affect the consumption of manufactured tobacco do not meet these requirements since these taxes are not neutral from the point of view of competition and often constitute serious obstacles to the interpenetration of markets ;
Whereas it is therefore in the interest of the Common Market that the rules for taxes affecting the consumption of manufactured tobacco should be harmonized , in order progressively to eliminate from the present systems those factors which are likely to hinder free movement and distort the conditions of competition , whether at national level or at Community level ;
Whereas the Council Directives of 11 April 1967 1 concern the harmonization of turnover taxes ;
Whereas , as far as excise duties are concerned , harmonization of structures must , among other things , result in competition in the different categories of manufactured tobacco belonging to the same group not being distorted by the effects of the charging of the tax and , consequently , in the opening of the national markets of the Member States ;
Whereas , as regards cigarettes , the abovementioned objective is best achieved by a system which provides for a degression in the incidence of the tax and whereas for this purpose , the tax imposed on these products should consist of a proportional excise duty combined with a specific excise duty , the amount of which is fixed by each Member State in accordance with Community criteria ;
Whereas the structures for excise duties on manufactured tobacco should be harmonized by stages ;
Whereas the imperative needs of competition imply a system of freely formed prices for all groups of manufactured tobacco ;
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE :
TITLE I General principles
Article 1
1 .
The structure of the excise duty to which the Member States subject manufactured tobacco shall be harmonized in several stages .
1OJ No 71 , 14.4.1967 , pp. 1301 / 67 and 1303 / 67 .
2 .
This Directive lays down general principles for this harmonization , as well as the special criteria applicable during the first stage of harmonization .
3 .
On the basis of Articles 99 and 100 of the Treaty , the Council shall , at least one year before the expiry of the period provided for in Article 7 ( 1 ) , adopt a Directive laying down the special criteria applicable during the following stage or stages .
4 .
The transition from one stage of harmonization to the next shall be decided on by the Council on a proposal from the Commission , taking into account the effects produced during the stage in progress by the measures introduced by the Member States into their system of excise duties in order to comply with the provisions applicable during that stage .
The transition from one stage to the next may be deferred especially if it is likely to involve disproportionate losses of revenue for a Member State .
Article 2
The Member States shall refrain from subjecting manufactured tobacco to any tax other than the excise duty referred to in Article 1 and the value added tax provided for in the Council Directive of 11 April 1967 .
1
Article 3
1 .
The following shall be considered to be manufactured tobacco : ( a ) cigarettes
( b ) cigars and cigarillos
( c ) smoking tobacco
( d ) snuff
( e ) chewing tobacco .
2 .
The Council shall , on a proposal from the Commission , adopt the provisions necessary to determine the way in which manufactured tobacco should be defined and classified in groups .
Article 4
1 .
In each Member State national and imported cigarettes shall be subjected to a proportional excise duty calculated on the maximum retail selling price , including Custom-duties , and also to a specific excise duty cals culated per unit of the product .
2 .
The rate of the proportional excise duty and the amount of the specific excise duty must be the same for all cigarettes .
3 .
At the final stage of harmonization of structures , the same ratio shall be established for cigarettes in all Member States between the proportional excise duty and the specific excise duty , in such a way that the range of retail selling prices reflects fairly the difference in the manufacturers ' delivery prices .
4 .
Where necessary , the excise duty on cigarettes may include a minimum tax component , the ceiling for which shall be determined for each stage by the Council on a proposal from the Commission .
Article 5
1 .
Manufacturers and importers shall be free to determine the maximum retail selling price for each of their products .
This provision may not , however , hinder implementation of the national systems of legislation regarding the control of price levels or the observance of imposed prices .
2 .
However , in order to facilitate the levying of the excise duty , the Member States may , for each group of manufactured tobacco , fix a scale of retail selling prices on condition that each scale has sufficient scope and variety to correspond in fact with the variety of Community products .
Each scale shall be valid for all the products belonging to the group of manufactured tobacco which it concerns , without distinction on the basis of quality , presentation , the origin of the products or of the materials used , the characteristics of the undertakings or of any other criterion .
Article 6
1 .
At the final stage at the latest the rules for collecting the excise duty shall be harmonized .
During the preceding stages the excise duty shall , in principle , be collected by means of tax stamps .
If they collect the excise duty by means of tax stamps , the Member States shall be obliged to make these stamps available to manufacturers and dealers in the other Member States .
If they collect the excise duty by other means , the Member States shall ensure that no obstacle , either administrative or technical , affects trade between the Member States on that account .
1OJ No 71 , 14.4.1967 , p .
1301 / 67 .
2 .
Importers and national manufacturers of manufactured tobacco shall be subject to the same system as regards the detailed rules for levying and paying the excise duty .
TITLE II Special provisions applicable during the first stage of harmonization
Article 7
1 .
Subject to Article 1 ( 4 ) , the first stage of harmonization of the structures of the excise duty on manufactured tobacco shall cover a period of 24 months from 1 July 1973 .
2 .
During this first stage of harmonization Articles 8 to 10 shall be applicable .
Article 8
1 .
The amount of the specific excise duty levied on cigarettes shall be established for the first time by reference to cigarettes in the most popular price category according to the data available on 1 January 1973 .
2 .
Without prejudice to the solution to be finally adopted regarding the ratio between the specific component and the proportional component , this amount may not be lower than 5 % or higher than 75 % of the aggregate amount of the proportional excise duty and the specific excise duty levied on these cigarettes .
3 .
If the excise duty on the price class referred to above is amended after 1 January 1973 , the amount of the specific excise duty shall be established by reference to the new tax burden on the cigarettes referred to in paragraph 1 .
Article 9
In derogation from Article 4 ( 1 ) , each Member State may exclude Customs duties from the basis of calculation of the proportional excise duty on cigarettes .
Article 10
The Member States may levy on cigarettes a minimum excise duty the amount of which may not , however , be higher than 90 % of the aggregate amount of the proportional excise duty and the specific excise duty which they levy on the cigarettes referred to at Article 8 ( 1 ) .
TITLE III Final provisions
Article 11
Where necessary , the Council shall , on a proposal from the Commission , adopt provisions for the application of this Directive .
Article 12
1 .
The Member States shall bring into force the provisions laid down by law , regulation or administrative action necessary to comply with the provisions of this Directive not later than 1 July 1973 , and shall inform the Commission immediately that they have done so .

The Member States shall communicate to the Commission the text of the main provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive .

Subject to such conditions and guarantees as it shall determine , each Contracting Party may authorize associations to issue TIR carnets , either directly or through corresponding associations , and to act as guarantors .
( 2 ) Ein Verband wird in einem Land nur zugelassen , wenn seine Bürgschaft sich auch auf die in diesem Lande entstehenden Verbindlichkeiten aus Warentransporten mit Carnets TIR erstreckt , die von ausländischen Verbänden ausgegeben worden sind , die derselben internationalen Organisaition wie der bürgende Verband angehören . An association shall not be approved in any country unless its guarantee also covers the liabilities incurred in that country in connection with operations under cover of TIR carnets issued by foreign associations affiliated to the same international organization as that to which it is itself affiliated .

( 2 ) Sehen die Gesetze und anderen Vorschriften einer Vertragspartei die Entrichtung der Eingangs - oder Ausgangsabgaben in den in Absatz 1 genannten Fällen nicht vor , so hat sich der bürgende Verband zu verpflichten , unter den gleichen Bedingungen eine Zahlung in Höhe der Eingangs - oder Ausgangsabgaben zuzueglich etwaiger Verzugszinsen zu leisten . In cases where the laws and regulations of a Contracting Party do not provide for payment of import or export duties and taxes as provided for in paragraph 1 above , the guaranteeing association shall undertake to pay , under the same conditions , a sum equal to the amount of the import or export duties and taxes and any default interest .
( 3 ) Jede Vertragspartei setzt den Hoechstbetrag fest , der nach den Absätzen 1 und 2 vom bürgenden Verband für jedes Carnet TIR gegebenenfalls gefordert werden kann .

It shall not extend to any other goods .
( 6 ) Die im Carnet TIR über die Waren enthaltenen Angaben gelten für die Festsetzung der in den Absätzen 1 und 2 genannten Abgaben bis zum Beweis des Gegenteils als richtig . For the purpose of determining the duties and taxes mentioned in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article , the particulars of the goods as entered in the TIR carnet shall , in the absence of evidence to the contrary , be assumed to be correct .
( 7 ) Die zuständigen Behörden haben soweit möglich bei Fälligkeit der in den Absätzen 1 und 2 genannten Beträge deren Entrichtung zunächst von der Person oder den Personen zu verlangen , die sie unmittelbar schulden , bevor der bürgende Verband zur Entrichtung dieser Beträge aufgefordert wird . When payment of sums mentioned in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article becomes due , the competent authorities shall so far as possible require payment from the person or persons directly liable before making a claim against the guaranteeing association .

The TIR carnet may be discharged unconditionally or conditionally ; where discharge is conditional this shall be on account of facts connected with the TIR operation itself .
These facts shall be clearly indicated in the TIR carnet .
( 2 ) Haben die Zollbehörden eines Landes ein Carnet TIR ohne Vorbehalt erledigt , so können sie vom bürgenden Verband die Entrichtung der in Artikel 8 Absätze 1 und 2 genannten Beträge nicht mehr verlangen , es sei denn , daß die Erledigungsbescheinigung mißbräuchlich oder betrügerisch erwirkt worden ist .

The claim for payment of the sums referred to in Article 8 ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) shall be made to the guaranteeing association at the earliest three months after the date on which the association was informed that the carnet had not been discharged or had been discharged conditionally or that the certificate of discharge had been obtained in an improper or fraudulent manner and at the latest not more than two years after that date .

However , certain conditions , which the BIS would be prepared to apply , can be indicated already :
The initial commitment of the BIS for each stand-by credit would be for two years with the option of renewal for other periods , the total not to exceed five years .
On the opening of credits , and whenever they are renewed , the BIS would take a Commission .
It would also be understood that , in order to allow it to carry out the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity , the first drawings would not take place until one month after the conclusion of the stand-by agreement .
Drawings would be in the currencies available to the BIS at the time the agreements were concluded , most probably in US dollars ; they would be for periods to be negotiated in the light of the Bank 's resources , probably three or six months .
The conditions would be equivalent to those applied by the BIS at the time for transactions concluded on similar terms , i.e. at close to market rates .
Normally , these rates should be only slightly above Libor .
However , if the BIS should itself have to have recourse to the market to procure the necessary funds , the rate applied could reach a maximum equivalent to Libor plus an appropriate margin .
I should be obliged if you would inform me whether the Council of the European Communities is in agreement with the above .
Please accept , Sir , the assurance of my highest consideration .

ARRANGEMENT in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Economic Community and the Argentine Republic on trade in mutton and lamb
Letter No 1
Sir ,
I have the honour to refer to the negotiations recently undertaken between our respective delegations for the purpose of drawing up provisions concerning import into the European Economic Community of mutton , lamb and goatmeat from Argentina , on connection with implementation by the Community of the common organization of the market in sheepmeat and goatmeat .
During these negotiations both parties agreed as follows : 1 .
This arrangement shall relate to : - fresh or chilled mutton , lamb and goatmeat ( 02.01 A IV a ) ) ,
- frozen mutton , lamb and goatmeat ( 02.01 A IV b ) ) .
2 .
Within the terms of this arrangement , the possibilities of export of mutton and lamb and goatmeat from Argentina to the Community are fixed at the following annual quantity : 20 000 tonnes expressed in carcass weight ( 1 ) .
In order to ensure the proper functioning of the arrangement , Argentina undertakes to implement the appropriate procedures to ensure that the annual quantity actually exported does not exceed the quantity agreed and shall be exported in accordance with the traditional patterns of presentation ( frozen or chilled ) .
Should changes in technology and trade make it possible to modify the presentational structure of trade , the two parties to this arrangement will consult each other prior to any such modification in the Committee mentioned in clause 10 in order to find an adequate solution .
3 .
Should the Community have recourse to the safeguard clause , it undertakes that Argentina 's access into the Community as provided for in this arrangement will not be affected .
4 .
If imports in any one year exceed the quantities agreed , the Community reserves the right to suspend imports from Argentina for the remainder of that year .
The quantity overshipped shall be offset against Argentina 's export entitlement for the following year .
5 .
5 . ( 1 ) Carcass weight ( bone-in equivalent weight ) .
Die Gemeinschaft verpflichtet sich , die Abschöpfung auf Einfuhren der von dieser Vereinbarung erfassten Erzeugnisse auf einen Hoechstsatz von 10 v.H . ad valorem zu beschränken . For this purpose 55 kg of boned mutton corresponds to 100 kg of bone-in mutton and 60 kg of boned lamb corresponds to 100 kg of bone-in lamb .
6 .
At the time of accession of new Member States , the Community , in consultation with Argentina , will alter the quantities set out in paragraph 2 , in accordance with Argentina 's trade with each new Member State .
The charges applicable to imports for the said new Member States shall be fixed in accordance with rules in the Treaty of Accession ; the maximum level of the levy specified in point 5 of this arrangement being taken into account .
The total quantity as mentioned in clause 2 above is fixed at 23 000 tonnes in carcass weight as from the date of accession of Greece to the Community .
7 .
The Community will endeavour to avoid any market development which could prejudice the marketing of Argentina 's mutton and lamb on the Community market within the limits of the quantities agreed .
In particular , the Community will take steps to ensure that the disposal of intervention stocks in frozen form arising from the operation of the regulation does not undermine such marketing of Argentina 's mutton and lamb .
8 .
In taking account of the objectives and provisions of this arrangement the Community agrees that any actual implementation of refunds or any other form of assistance with respect to exports of mutton , lamb and live sheep and lamb intended for slaughter will apply only at prices and on conditions which comply with existing international obligations and in respect of the traditional shares of the Community of world export trade in these products .
These words shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with Article XVI of GATT and in particular in conformity with Article 10 ( 2 ) ( c ) of the Agreement on interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XXIII of the General Agreement on tariffs and trade .
9 .
Argentina shall ensure that this arrangement is observed , in particular , by issuing export certificates covering the products referred to in paragraph 1 within the limits of the quantities covered by this arrangement .
For its part , the Community shall undertake to adopt all necessary provisions to make the issue of the import certificates for the products referred to above , originating in Argentina , subject to the presentation of an export certificate , issued by the competent authority designated by the Argentine Government .
Detailed rules for applying this system shall be laid down in such a way as to render unnecessary the lodging of a security for the issue of the import certificate in respect of the products in question .
Also , such detailed rules of application shall provide that the competent Argentine authority shall communicate periodically to the competent authority of the Community the quantities in respect of which export certificates are issued , broken down , where appropriate , according to destination .
10 .
A consultative committee shall be set up composed of representatives from the Community and from Argentina .
The Committee shall ensure that the arrangement is being properly applied and is functioning smoothly .
It will examine regularly the trend of the two parties ' markets in mutton and lamb and goatmeat and the trend of the international market , as well as marketing conditions on those markets including those relevant to the objective set out in clause 7 of this arrangement .
It will ensure that the proper application of the arrangement is not affected by the export of mutton and lamb and goatmeat-based products to the Community under customs headings not referred to by the arrangement .
The Committee will discuss all questions which could arise in applying the arrangement and will recommend appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
11 .
The provisions of this arrangement shall be agreed without prejudice to the parties ' rights and obligations under GATT .
12 .
The annual quantity fixed in clause 2 refers to the period running from 1 January to 31 December .

The quantity applicable as of the implementation of the present arrangement and until 1 January of the following year will be fixed on a pro rata basis in relation to the total annual quantity and will take into account the seasonality of the trade .
13 .
This arrangement shall apply , on the one hand , to the territories in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied and under the conditions laid down in that Treaty and , on the other hand , to the territory of the Argentine Republic .
14 .
The Agreement shall enter into force on 20 October 1980 .
It shall remain in force until 31 March 1984 , and shall continue in force thereafter subject to each party having the right to denounce it by giving one year 's notice in writing .
In any case the provisions of this arrangement will be examined by the two parties before 1 April 1984 with a view to making any adjustment which they agree is necessary .
I should be obliged if you would kindly confirm the agreement of your Government to the foregoing .
Please accept , Sir , the assurance of my highest consideration .
For the Council of the European Communities

Sir ,
I have the honour to refer to the negotiations recently undertaken between our respective delegations for the purpose of drawing up provisions concerning import into the European Economic Community of mutton , lamb and goatmeat from Argentina , on connection with implementation by the Community of the common organization of the market in sheepmeat and goatmeat .

Within the terms of this arrangement , the possibilities of export of mutton and lamb and goatmeat from Argentina to the Community are fixed at the following annual quantity : 20 000 tonnes expressed in carcass weight ( 1 ) .

Should changes in technology and trade make it possible to modify the presentational structure of trade , the two parties to this arrangement will consult each other prior to any such modification in the Committee mentioned in clause 10 in order to find an adequate solution .
3 .
Should the Community have recourse to the safeguard clause , it undertakes that Argentina 's access into the Community as provided for in this arrangement will not be affected .

3. Internationale Normen und internationale Einheiten International Standards and International Units
International Standards have been established by the World Health Organization for anti-A and anti-B and incomplete anti-D blood-grouping reagents and are in process of being established for blood-grouping reagents of other specificities .
An International Standard Preparation contains , by definition , a certain number of International Units per mg or ml and this definition is independent of the titres observed against particular red corpuscle preparations ( 2 ) .
( 1 ) At the time of approving the present version of the Protocol and its Annexes , it was understood by the representatives of the Contracting Parties that when in the English text of the Agreement the expression " blood incompatibilities " was mentioned , " blood grouping incompatibilities " was implied .
It was also agreed that the expression " blood-grouping " with a hyphen in the English text on the Agreement and of the Protocol should read as " blood grouping " without a hyphen .
( 2 ) The potency of blood-grouping reagents of most specificities is expressed as the agglutination titre observed in a dilution series , against a suspension of red cells .
The titre indicates the dilution of reagent in the last mixture of the series which shows agglutination microscopically visible .
Die Wirksamkeit der Reagenzien zur Blutgruppenbestimmung , für die Internationale Standardpräparate vorhanden sind ( zur Zeit Anti-A und Anti-B sowie inkomplettes Anti-D ) , kann auf der Grundlage der Titration des unbekannten Reagenzes im Vergleich zum Internationalen Standardpräparat oder einem staatlichen Normenpräparat in Internationalen Einheiten ( Siehe Bulletin WHO OMS 1954 , 10 , 937 , 941 - 1950 , 3 , 301. ) ausgedrückt werden . 1954 , 10 , 937 , 941-1950 , 3 , 301 ) on the basis of the titration of the unknown reagent in comparison with the International Standard , or a national sub-standard .
The International Standard Preparations of blood-grouping sera are dispensed in ampoules containing dried human serum .
When reconstituted to the volume of 1 ml , the anti-A and anti-B sera contain by definition 256 International Units per ml .
They can be obtained free of charge , from the International Laboratory for Biological Standards of WHO , Statens Seruminstitut , Copenhagen .

( b ) SERA OF HUMAN ORIGIN FOR Rh GROUPING
Anti-Rh blood-grouping sera , whatever their specificity , may be of either of two varieties differing in the conditions under which agglutination of homologous corpuscles is obtained .
Certain sera commonly known as " complete " agglutinate corpuscles suspended in saline .
With others , commonly known as " incomplete " , agglutination can only be obtained in the presence of certain colloids such as bovine albumin or by means of other special techniques .
The sera should be used under the conditions specified by the laboratory preparing them .
Some " incomplete " sera will also agglutinate homologous red corpuscles suspended in their own serum or plasma on slides .
The following requirements of potency for Rh grouping sera may need to be revised when International Standard Preparations become available . ( i ) Anti-D ( anti-Rho ) blood-grouping serum ( human )
Anti-D serum is derived from the blood of one or more persons immunized by the D antigen of the Rh system .
It reacts with human red corpuscles containing the D antigen , but not with human red corpuscles which do not contain the D antigen .
Potency
Titration
" Complete " anti-D sera shall have a titre of not less than 32 against CcDee cells in a solution containing 9 grams sodium chloride per litre .
An " incomplete " anti-D serum shall be titrated against CcDee corpuscles in parallel with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of Incomplete Anti-D ( anti-Rho ) or an equivalent reference preparation .
It shall have a potency of not less than 32 International Units .
Besides reacting with all red corpuscles containing the D antigen , the serum should , as far as possible , react with corpuscles containing the Du antigen .
Determination of avidity
Anti-D sera intended for use in the slide test of Diamond and Abelson should , when mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a 40 to 50 % suspension of CcDee corpuscles at approximately 40 ° C , show visible agglutination within 30 seconds , and agglutination should be complete within 120 seconds .
( ii ) Anti-C ( anti Rh ' ) blood-grouping serum ( human )
Anti-C serum is derived from the blood of one or more persons immunized by the C agglutinogen of the Rh system .
It agglutinates suspensions of human red corpuscles containing the C antigen , but not with human red corpuscles which do not contain the C antigen .
In this connection the C antigen is regarded as including the Cw antigen .
Most diagnostic anti-C sera contain " complete " anti-C together with " incomplete " anti-D .
These sera are therefore specific for the C antigen only when the cells under test are suspended in a solution containing 9 grams sodium chloride per litre .
Potency
Titration
Anti-C sera ( " complete " or " incomplete " ) should have a titre of not less than 8 against Ccddee corpuscles .
Determination of avidity
Anti-C sera intended for use in the slide test of Diamond and Abelson ( and which must not contain any form of anti-D ) should , when mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a suspension of Ccddee cells with a volume fraction of 0,4 to 0,5 , at approximately 40 ° C , show visible agglutination within 30 seconds , and agglutination should be complete within 120 seconds .
( iii ) Anti-E ( anti-rh " ) blood-grouping serum ( human )
Anti-E serum is derived from the blood of one or more persons immunized by the E antigen of the Rh system .
It reacts with human red corpuscles containing the E antigen .
Potency
Titration
Anti-E sera ( " complete " or " incomplete " ) should have a titre of not less than 8 against ccddEe corpuscles .
Determination of avidity
Anti-E sera intended for use in the slide test of Diamond and Abelson ( and which must contain any form of anti-D ) should , when mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a suspension of ccddEe cells with a volume fraction of 0,4 to 0,5 , at approximately 40 ° C , show visible agglutination within 30 seconds , and agglutination should be complete within 120 seconds .
( iv ) Anti-D + C ( anti-Rhorh ' ) blood-grouping serum ( human )
Anti-D + E ( anti-Rhorh " ) blood-grouping serum ( human )
Sera of specificity anti-D + C and of specificity anti-D + E may be obtained directly from the blood of immunized individuals or may be prepared by mixing anti-D with anti-C or anti-E serum .
In a given serum both antibodies must be simultaneously active under the conditions of reaction specified by the producer .
Each serum must react with all types of red corpuscles which would react with either of the component antibodies , and must fail to react with red corpuscles which contain neither the C nor D antigen in the case of anti-D + C and neither D nor E antigen in the case of anti-D + E. The titres should not be less than those specified for the component antibodies , but in the case of anti-D + C ( which is a frequent combination in the serum of immunized persons ) it is desirable that the anti-C titre should be not less than 32 and in the case of anti-D + E it is desirable that the anti-E titre should be not less than 8 .
Where a serum is intended for use in the slide test of Diamond and Abelson , the times of agglutination for all reacting types of red corpuscles should be not less than those specified for the component antibodies .

( b ) SERA OF HUMAN ORIGIN FOR Rh GROUPING
Anti-Rh blood-grouping sera , whatever their specificity , may be of either of two varieties differing in the conditions under which agglutination of homologous corpuscles is obtained .
Certain sera commonly known as " complete " agglutinate corpuscles suspended in saline .
With others , commonly known as " incomplete " , agglutination can only be obtained in the presence of certain colloids such as bovine albumin or by means of other special techniques .
The sera should be used under the conditions specified by the laboratory preparing them .
Some " incomplete " sera will also agglutinate homologous red corpuscles suspended in their own serum or plasma on slides .
The following requirements of potency for Rh grouping sera may need to be revised when International Standard Preparations become available . ( i ) Anti-D ( anti-Rho ) blood-grouping serum ( human )
Anti-D serum is derived from the blood of one or more persons immunized by the D antigen of the Rh system .
It reacts with human red corpuscles containing the D antigen , but not with human red corpuscles which do not contain the D antigen .
Potency
Titration
" Complete " anti-D sera shall have a titre of not less than 32 against CcDee cells in a solution containing 9 grams sodium chloride per litre .
An " incomplete " anti-D serum shall be titrated against CcDee corpuscles in parallel with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of Incomplete Anti-D ( anti-Rho ) or an equivalent reference preparation .
It shall have a potency of not less than 32 International Units .
Besides reacting with all red corpuscles containing the D antigen , the serum should , as far as possible , react with corpuscles containing the Du antigen .
Determination of avidity
Anti-D sera intended for use in the slide test of Diamond and Abelson should , when mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a 40 to 50 % suspension of CcDee corpuscles at approximately 40 ° C , show visible agglutination within 30 seconds , and agglutination should be complete within 120 seconds .
( ii ) Anti-C ( anti Rh ' ) blood-grouping serum ( human )
Anti-C serum is derived from the blood of one or more persons immunized by the C agglutinogen of the Rh system .
It agglutinates suspensions of human red corpuscles containing the C antigen , but not with human red corpuscles which do not contain the C antigen .
In this connection the C antigen is regarded as including the Cw antigen .
Most diagnostic anti-C sera contain " complete " anti-C together with " incomplete " anti-D .
These sera are therefore specific for the C antigen only when the cells under test are suspended in a solution containing 9 grams sodium chloride per litre .
Potency
Titration
Anti-C sera ( " complete " or " incomplete " ) should have a titre of not less than 8 against Ccddee corpuscles .
Determination of avidity
Anti-C sera intended for use in the slide test of Diamond and Abelson ( and which must not contain any form of anti-D ) should , when mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a suspension of Ccddee cells with a volume fraction of 0,4 to 0,5 , at approximately 40 ° C , show visible agglutination within 30 seconds , and agglutination should be complete within 120 seconds .
( iii ) Anti-E ( anti-rh " ) blood-grouping serum ( human )
Anti-E serum is derived from the blood of one or more persons immunized by the E antigen of the Rh system .
It reacts with human red corpuscles containing the E antigen .
Potency
Titration
Anti-E sera ( " complete " or " incomplete " ) should have a titre of not less than 8 against ccddEe corpuscles .
Determination of avidity
Anti-E sera intended for use in the slide test of Diamond and Abelson ( and which must contain any form of anti-D ) should , when mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a suspension of ccddEe cells with a volume fraction of 0,4 to 0,5 , at approximately 40 ° C , show visible agglutination within 30 seconds , and agglutination should be complete within 120 seconds .
( iv ) Anti-D + C ( anti-Rhorh ' ) blood-grouping serum ( human )
Anti-D + E ( anti-Rhorh " ) blood-grouping serum ( human )
Sera of specificity anti-D + C and of specificity anti-D + E may be obtained directly from the blood of immunized individuals or may be prepared by mixing anti-D with anti-C or anti-E serum .
In a given serum both antibodies must be simultaneously active under the conditions of reaction specified by the producer .
Each serum must react with all types of red corpuscles which would react with either of the component antibodies , and must fail to react with red corpuscles which contain neither the C nor D antigen in the case of anti-D + C and neither D nor E antigen in the case of anti-D + E. The titres should not be less than those specified for the component antibodies , but in the case of anti-D + C ( which is a frequent combination in the serum of immunized persons ) it is desirable that the anti-C titre should be not less than 32 and in the case of anti-D + E it is desirable that the anti-E titre should be not less than 8 .
Where a serum is intended for use in the slide test of Diamond and Abelson , the times of agglutination for all reacting types of red corpuscles should be not less than those specified for the component antibodies .

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT ON OLIVE OIL AND TABLE OLIVES , 1986
PREAMBLE
THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT ,
BEARING IN MIND that the olive tree :
- is not only a plant indispensable for the maintenance and conservation of soils , but one which makes it possible to develop land that will not bear other crops and which , even under non-intensive farming conditions , which account for the bulk of present production , responds favourably to any improvement in cultivation ,
- is a perennial fruit tree that , with appropriate techniques , permits a return on what is invested in its cultivation ,
EMPHASIZING that its cultivation governs the existence and standard of living of millions of families which are wholly dependent on the measures taken to maintain and expand the consumption of its products , both in the producing countries themselves and in non-producing consumer countries ,
MINDFUL that olive oil and table olives are essential basic commodities in the regions where olive-growing is established ,
BEARING IN MIND that the essential feature of olive production lies in irregular harvests and in the irregularity with which supplies reach the market , and that this results in fluctuations in the value of production , instability of prices and export earnings , and considerable differences in producers incomes ,
BEARING IN MIND that these circumstances give rise to special difficulties which may seriously harm the interests of producers and consumers and jeopardize general policies of economic expansion in countries in the regiones where olive-growing is established ,
EMPHASIZING in this connection the major importance of olive production to the economies of many countries , particularly developing olive-growing countries ,
MINDFUL that the measures to be taken in the light of the very particular characteristics of olive-growing and of the market for its products transcend the national sphere , and that international action is essential ,
CONSIDERING the International Olive Oil Agreement , 1956 , as amended by the Protocol of 3 April 1958 , as well as the International Olive Oil Agreement , 1963 , as extended and amended on several occasions , and the International Olive Oil Agreement , 1979 ,
CONSIDERING that the 1979 Agreement will expire on 31 December 1986 ,
BEING OF THE VIEW that it is essential to continue and develop the work undertaken within the framework of the said Agreements and that it is desirable to conclude a new Agreement ,
HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS :
CHAPTER I

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT ON OLIVE OIL AND TABLE OLIVES , 1986
PREAMBLE
THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT ,
BEARING IN MIND that the olive tree :
- is not only a plant indispensable for the maintenance and conservation of soils , but one which makes it possible to develop land that will not bear other crops and which , even under non-intensive farming conditions , which account for the bulk of present production , responds favourably to any improvement in cultivation ,
- is a perennial fruit tree that , with appropriate techniques , permits a return on what is invested in its cultivation ,
EMPHASIZING that its cultivation governs the existence and standard of living of millions of families which are wholly dependent on the measures taken to maintain and expand the consumption of its products , both in the producing countries themselves and in non-producing consumer countries ,
MINDFUL that olive oil and table olives are essential basic commodities in the regions where olive-growing is established ,
BEARING IN MIND that the essential feature of olive production lies in irregular harvests and in the irregularity with which supplies reach the market , and that this results in fluctuations in the value of production , instability of prices and export earnings , and considerable differences in producers incomes ,
BEARING IN MIND that these circumstances give rise to special difficulties which may seriously harm the interests of producers and consumers and jeopardize general policies of economic expansion in countries in the regiones where olive-growing is established ,
EMPHASIZING in this connection the major importance of olive production to the economies of many countries , particularly developing olive-growing countries ,
MINDFUL that the measures to be taken in the light of the very particular characteristics of olive-growing and of the market for its products transcend the national sphere , and that international action is essential ,
CONSIDERING the International Olive Oil Agreement , 1956 , as amended by the Protocol of 3 April 1958 , as well as the International Olive Oil Agreement , 1963 , as extended and amended on several occasions , and the International Olive Oil Agreement , 1979 ,
CONSIDERING that the 1979 Agreement will expire on 31 December 1986 ,
BEING OF THE VIEW that it is essential to continue and develop the work undertaken within the framework of the said Agreements and that it is desirable to conclude a new Agreement ,
HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS :
